# Fake News Detection

## What is Fake News?
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. However, the term does not have a fixed definition, and has been applied more broadly to include any type of false information, including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also by high-profile individuals to apply to any news unfavourable to his/her personal perspectives.

## Abstract
News is published daily but how do we distinguish it from being real or fake news? The purpose of this study is to identify factors that can be used to classify an article to be real or fake. Factors that can be inspected by viewers before they start reading.

As articles are relatively large, a machine learning model will be trained to classify articles as real or fake based on previous observations. This can be useful in identifying articles that are fake and remove them before readers become misled.
